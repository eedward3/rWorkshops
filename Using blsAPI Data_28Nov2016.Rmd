title: "Using blsAPI Data"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. The purpose is to explain how to use the CRAN package [blsAPI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blsAPI/index.html) by Michael Silva. This package allows the user to directly import API data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/) into R-Studio. 

### Installing the blsAPI package

This step installs the two CRAN Packages "blsAPI" and "rjson".  
"blsAPI" pulls API data directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  
"rjson" is needed as "blsAPI" is written in json and needs to be understood in R

```{r}
install.packages('blsAPI')
install.packages('rjson')
```

### Loading the packages for use

To use the two packages the user must individually load them into their working directory.

```{r}
library(blsAPI)
library(rjson)
```

### Calling the data

First create the variable "response". This variable represents the data from the blsAPI using its Series ID. Our example uses the Series ID CIU1010000000000A which represents the dataset "Total compensation for All Civilian workers in All industries and occupations"

```{r}
response <- blsAPI('CIU1010000000000A')
response
```

Next assign the variable "json" the value of the variable "response" as an R object.  
The function fromJSON converts json into a more readable format in R. 

```{r}
json <- fromJSON(response)
json
```

Next assign the variable "df" the value of the data frame using the given data.  
StringsAsFactors=FALSE tells R to keep character variables as character variables rather than converting them into factors.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(year=character(),
                 period=character(),
                 periodName=character(),
                 value=character(),
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

Lastly, create a for-loop to pull the data from each data heading in a readable format.  
The variable "i" is a commonly used variable for loops that stands for "index". Giving i the value of 0 gives the starting position of the data frame. *Note: were i <- 3, the data frame would start at row 3.*  

```{r}
i <- 0
```


The following will complete the for-loop.  
"d" is a stand-in variable in loops. It represents each variable the code will loop through.  
i <- i+1 represents row positioning. *Note: i+3 would format the data to list every third row of the data frame.*  
The function "unlist" will unlist a list of vectors into a single vector.  
[i,] represents i as the rows and the columns open for each variable the code will loop through.

```{r}
for(d in json$Results$series[[1]]$data){
  i <- i+1
  df[i,] <- unlist(d)
}

df
```

### The code all together

Here the code is compiled for easy viewing. 
```{r}
install.packages('blsAPI')
install.packages('rjson')

library(blsAPI)
library(rjson)

response <- blsAPI('CIU1010000000000A')
response

json <- fromJSON(response)
json

df <- data.frame(year=character(),
                 period=character(),
                 periodName=character(),
                 value=character(),
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

i <- 0
for(d in json$Results$series[[1]]$data){
  i <- i+1
  df[i,] <- unlist(d)
}

df
```

### Additional Information

The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides datasets in a single format. Therefore, inputting the appropriate Series ID in line 5 of the code will allow this code to be affective with any of the BLS API datasets.
